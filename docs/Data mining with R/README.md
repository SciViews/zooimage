# Data mining applications with R

Here are additional material and examples for chapter 13: Supervised classification
of images, applied to plankton samples using R and zooimage of the Data Mining 
Applications with R book (http://www.rdatamining.com/books/dmar).


## Installation

* All required packages are available from CRAN. In R make:

```r
install.packages("zooimage")
```

## Example dataset

Download and unzip 'Data mining with R.zip' somewhere on your disk. Run the script
that is located in the `/R` subdirectory after changing the line defining `'rootpath'`
to point to the directory where you unzipped the examples.
