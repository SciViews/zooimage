Description: This package provides alternate interface to various machine
    learning algorithms in order to offer a unified, formula-based, interface.
    However, given the caveats of the formula interface in R (leading to
    multiple copies of the data), if a simplified formula is provided (like
    Class ~ .), a more performant code is used, if possible. Confusion matrices
    can be calculated and viewed as tables or plots, too.
