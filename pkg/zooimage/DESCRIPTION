Description: ZooImage is a free (open source) solution for analyzing digital
	images of zooplankton. In combination with ImageJ, a free image analysis
	system, it processes digital images, measures individuals, trains for
	automatic identification of taxa, and finally, measures zooplankton samples
	(abundances, total and partial size spectra or biomasses, etc.)
License: GPL2 or above at your convenience. Send metadata and reprints to maintainer
	for every series you analyze and every paper you publish using ZooImage (see the
	web site for further informations).
