== Changes in zooimage 5.4-1

* Correction of various bugs by Guillaume Wacquet.


== Changes in zooimage 5.4-0

* Functions to count cells in a particle (colony): countCells() and the
  corresponding countCellsGUI() function for an access through the menu.

* Function to build predictive models for cells in particles (colonies) after
  counting: cellModel().

* Function to compute the number of cells in particles in a new sample:
  cellCompute().
  
* Function to make zidb file for FlowCAM data through the menu:
  makeZidbMakeFlowCAM().

* Correct makeClass() function in the menu (missing formula).
  
* Functions to process active learning: contextSelection(), the associated
  addItemsToTrain() and dropItemsToTrain() functions to complete the training
  set with validated items, and the corresponding activeLearningGUI() function
  for an access through the menu. Integration in the classification process.
  
* Function compTrain() to compare two training sets and highlight differences.

* Translation of the user manual in French and update to include all changes.

* Adaptation of menus to include also the new features.


== Changes in zooimage 5.3-0

* calcVarsVIS() now included in calcVars() and not accessible any more as top
  function (to avoid duplicate code).

* ecd() and ecdCell() are now merged in ecd() using arguments cells = 1.

* errorCorrection() and planktonSorterPage() functions now use the new interface
  to get R httpd server port, for R svn rev >= 67550.
  
* In the shiny app, dataTableOutput is now called from the DT package.
  Dependency to DT is now added.
  
* The planktonSorter html page was sometimes too small, with the last group
  being wrapped consequently. Solved by increasing the page by 1 pixel * groups.
  
* A bug in processSample() prevented for calculation with both 'keep=' and a
  data frame for 'biomass=' provided simultaneously.


== Changes in zooimage 5.2-0

* importFlowCAM() now can deal with color FlowCAM images (but they are first
  converted into grayscale because background calibration images are recorded
  as grayscale by Visual Spreadsheet -at least, the tested version 3.2.3-, hence
  we cannot subtract the background of the vignettes in color mode)!
  
* importFlowCAM() now iterates a message to indicate progression of vignettes
  importation.
  
* For importFlowCAM(), the default value of the argument 'rgb.vigs' is changed
  from 'TRUE' to 'FALSE'.
  
* Functions to count cells in a particle (colony): cellCount() and the
  corresponding cellCountGUI() function for an access through the menu.

* New utility function ecdCell() to calculate the ECD for one cell in a colony.

## TODO:
* Functions to build predictive models for cells in particles (colonies) after counting:   
  cellModel().

* Function to compute the number of cells in particles in a new sample: cellCompute().
  


* Function to make zidb file for FlowCAM data through the menu: zidbMakeFlowCAMGUI().

* Correct makeClass() function in the menu (missing formula).


== Changes in zooimage 5.1-0

* calcVars()/calcVarsVIS() and dropVars() are reworked to used only FIT_xxx
  variables in case of use of the FlowCAM (and to calculated many derived vars
  from there). This way, there is no need any more of a second image analysis
  in ImageJ.
  
* A new UI for error correction using shiny.
  

== Changes in zooimage 5.0-0

* importFlowCAM() and readFlowCAMlst() are reworked to create complete .zidb
  files using all metadata from various version of Fluid Imaging's Visual
  Spreadsheet software.
  

== Changes in zooimage 4.0-2

* correctError() has now a mode argument allowing to run the analysis in 'demo'
  and 'stat' mode, in addition to the default 'validation' mode
  
* The internal errorCorrection() function did not intialized ntrusted and
  nsuspect in 'demo' mode
  
* New version of the user manual (explanations of the new functions).


== Changes in zooimage 4.0-1

* A bug (non initialisation of the confusion matrix) prevented to use
  errorCorrection() in demo or stat mode. Corrected.


== Changes in zooimage 4.0-0

* Error correction functions added: correctError().

* Plankton sorter interface to manual validation added.

* New dependency on the digest package.

* A new menu entry, Validate classification..., is added for validation and
  error correction.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-7

* readFlowCAMlst() can now read Visual Spreadsheet .lst file format 017 where
  the name of the columns is explicitly provided in the header of the file.
  
* zimDatMakeFlowCAM() now uses readFlowCAMlst() instead of the hidden function
  .lstRead() to avoid duplicated code.
  
* zidVerify() now builds automatically the _dat1.zim file from FlowCAM data if
  it is not there, but corresponding .lst and .zim files are found in the parent
  directory.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-6

* zidUncompress() unzipped files in current dir., ignoring its path argument.
  Solved now.
  
* zidUncompressAll() now computes full names for zidfiles argument by default.

* calcVarsVIS() added. Specific function to calculate derived variables from
  FlowCAM's Visualspreadsheet software.
  
* Added the extraction of RGB vignettes when importing FlowCAM data.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-5

* Functions to import FlowCAM data directly.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-4

* Default dropVars(): adding a few items, including 'Skew', 'Kurt' and
  'Solidity' that produce NAs in ImageJ for multiple ROIs objects.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-3

* Minor adaptations to DESCRIPTION file.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-2

* Assignment to .GlobalEnv is strictly restricted to GUI operations, and only
  following direct request by the end-user through an explicit dialog box. The
  internal function .assignGlobal() is used for that purpose.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-1

* getTrain() was not able to collect data when attributes measured on samples
  mixed in training set differ slightly. Now, data are more carefully merged.
  
* Meaningless FIT_xxx attributes from the FlowCAM are now excluded by default
  in dropVars().
  
* The GUI function vignettesClass(), and thus, the corresponding menu entry
  were not implemented (the function prepareTest() that is called internally
  was working properly, but was not reacheable through the menu). Done now.
  
* The GUI function analyzeClass() and the corresponding menu entry listed old
  (version 2) items. The list is now updated with new plots available in
  zooimage 3 and mlearning 1.
  
* All the java code (ImageJ + zooimage plugins) are now moved to zooimageJ.
  

== Changes in zooimage 3.0-0

This is a major refactoring of code from zooimage 1.x and 2.X.
