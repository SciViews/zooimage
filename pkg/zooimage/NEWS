== Changes in zooimage 5.1-0

* calcVars()/calcVarsVIS() and dropVars() are reworked to used only FIT_xxx
  variables in case of use of the FlowCAM (and to calculated many derived vars
  from there). This way, there is no need any more of a second image analysis
  in ImageJ.
  

== Changes in zooimage 5.0-0

* importFlowCAM() and readFlowCAMlst() are reworked to create complete .zidb
  files using all metadata from various version of Fluid Imaging's Visual
  Spreadsheet software.
  

== Changes in zooimage 4.0-2

* correctError() has now a mode argument allowing to run the analysis in 'demo'
  and 'stat' mode, in addition to the default 'validation' mode
  
* The internal errorCorrection() function did not intialized ntrusted and
  nsuspect in 'demo' mode
  
* New version of the user manual (explanations of the new functions).


== Changes in zooimage 4.0-1

* A bug (non initialisation of the confusion matrix) prevented to use
  errorCorrection() in demo or stat mode. Corrected.


== Changes in zooimage 4.0-0

* Error correction functions added: correctError().

* Plankton sorter interface to manual validation added.

* New dependency on the digest package.

* A new menu entry, Validate classification..., is added for validation and
  error correction.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-7

* readFlowCAMlst() can now read Visual Spreadsheet .lst file format 017 where
  the name of the columns is explicitly provided in the header of the file.
  
* zimDatMakeFlowCAM() now uses readFlowCAMlst() instead of the hidden function
  .lstRead() to avoid duplicated code.
  
* zidVerify() now builds automatically the _dat1.zim file from FlowCAM data if
  it is not there, but corresponding .lst and .zim files are found in the parent
  directory.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-6

* zidUncompress() unzipped files in current dir., ignoring its path argument.
  Solved now.
  
* zidUncompressAll() now computes full names for zidfiles argument by default.

* calcVarsVIS() added. Specific function to calculate derived variables from
  FlowCAM's Visualspreadsheet software.
  
* Added the extraction of RGB vignettes when importing FlowCAM data.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-5

* Functions to import FlowCAM data directly.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-4

* Default dropVars(): adding a few items, including 'Skew', 'Kurt' and
  'Solidity' that produce NAs in ImageJ for multiple ROIs objects.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-3

* Minor adaptations to DESCRIPTION file.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-2

* Assignment to .GlobalEnv is strictly restricted to GUI operations, and only
  following direct request by the end-user through an explicit dialog box. The
  internal function .assignGlobal() is used for that purpose.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-1

* getTrain() was not able to collect data when attributes measured on samples
  mixed in training set differ slightly. Now, data are more carefully merged.
  
* Meaningless FIT_xxx attributes from the FlowCAM are now excluded by default
  in dropVars().
  
* The GUI function vignettesClass(), and thus, the corresponding menu entry
  were not implemented (the function prepareTest() that is called internally
  was working properly, but was not reacheable through the menu). Done now.
  
* The GUI function analyzeClass() and the corresponding menu entry listed old
  (version 2) items. The list is now updated with new plots available in
  zooimage 3 and mlearning 1.
  
* All the java code (ImageJ + zooimage plugins) are now moved to zooimageJ.
  

== Changes in zooimage 3.0-0

This is a major refactoring of code from zooimage 1.x and 2.X.
