== Changes in zooimage 3.0-2

* Assignment to .GlobalEnv is strictly restricted to GUI operations, and only
  following direct request by the end-user through an explicit dialog box. The
  internal function .assignGlobal() is used for that purpose.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-1

* getTrain() was not able to collect data when attributes measured on samples
  mixed in training set differ slightly. Now, data are more carefully merged.
  
* Meaningless FIT_xxx attributes from the FlowCAM are now excluded by default
  in dropVars().
  
* The GUI function vignettesClass(), and thus, the corresponding menu entry
  were not implemented (the function prepareTest() that is called internally
  was working properly, but was not reacheable through the menu). Done now.
  
* The GUI function analyzeClass() and the corresponding menu entry listed old
  (version 2) items. The list is now updated with new plots available in
  zooimage 3 and mlearning 1.
  
* All the java code (ImageJ + zooimage plugins) are now moved to zooimageJ.
