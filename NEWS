== Changes in zooimage 5.4-11

* Vignettes can now be created from within R, using the new makeZIVignettes()
  function.

* zidbMake() and makeZidb() are updated to handle the new 'ZI5' format with
  tinted vignettes created directly from within R.


== Changes in zooimage 5.4-10

* sampleInfo() now can process _dat3.zim and _dat5.zim files as well as the
  original _dat1.zim files.

* checkFirstLine() can now deal with ZI1 - ZI5 files.

* zimDatList() now recognize _dat1.zim, _dat3.zim and _dat5.zim files.

* zidDatMake() now creates ZI5 files.

* zisRead() now tries to convert date, but if it fails, it continues leaving the
  unmodified string and issues a warning.

* zidbMake() now creates ZI5 files and can replace <<<SMP>>> in label,
  <<<DATE>>> in date, and <<<TIME>>> in time metadata fields with appropriate
  values. Note that time must be provided in the new 'smptime =' argument. In
  case CellPart is missing, the default value of 0.73 is assumed. Similarly, if
  Replicates is missing, a value of 1 is assumed by default. The
  'check.vignettes =' is now FALSE by default, since we may generate them on the
  fly.


== Changes in zooimage 5.4-9

* A bug in errorCorrection() led to fail with message telling it is impossible
to replace 'GpFPDiff' because replacement has 0 rows and data has xxx.

* Plankton sorter pages used file://<path>/planktonSorter.html?v=xxxx, but the
argument v= is falsely interpretted as part of the file path in Linux. So, the
version information of the page is now dropped.

* Function imported from grDevices, graphics and stats are now declared in
NAMESPACE.


== Changes in zooimage 5.4-8

* A bug in processSamplesWithCells() failed to select another "cells.rds" file
when a default one is recorded.

* recode.ZITrain and reode.ZITest mangled completely the classes when depth =
argument was provided. Corrected.

* Warnings were issued when zieCompile() did not found calibration images.
Corrected.

* The processSamples() function was not able to deal with .zid files any more.
Now, it can use both .zid and .zidb files, but not a mix of them simultaneously.

* A regression prevented zieMake() to finialize the .zim files from a .zie
template. Corrected.

* In errorCorrection(), a table with items not sorted alphabetically led to a
mix in the correction/validation of the vignettes. Corrected.


== Changes in zooimage 5.4-7

* Correction of a bug that prevented the calculation of cells per colonies to
work (changes in cellCompute() not taken into account here).

* The calibration() function to calibrate grayscale for flat-bed scanner
  is rewritten to use only R code.

* A wrong default argument in makeZidb() is replaced with a more sensible value.

* processSample() and processSampleAll(): new defaults for keep= and detail=
  arguments (takes classes with uppercase first character), and a couple of minor
  bug corrections.

* Several bugs corrected in viewResults() and exportResults().

* External executables (Vuescan, Fiji or ImageJ, XnView and metadata editor) are
  not distributed any more with zooimage because this is not allowed by CRAN.
  The routine to detect those programs is more robust for Mac (should be in the
  Applications folder), and under Windows where it looks for a /Zooimage/bin
  folder into the Program Files (64bit first, then 32bit).

* Correction of a bug in zidbMake() in the computation of the zidb file name.


== Changes in zooimage 5.4-6

* The default dropVars() function now also drops "MinFeret", "AR" and "Round"
  that make problems between old and new samples.


== Changes in zooimage 5.4-5

* A bug in activeLearing() function prevented to use data and/or classifiers
  build with versions of zooimage older than 5.4-x. Corrected.


== Changes in zooimage 5.4-4

* Various bugs corrected in the new functions for cells counting, calculation
  of samples using cells counting and the plankton sorter GUI.


== Changes in zooimage 5.4-3

* Cells counting per colonies (per particles) is now provided.

* processSamples() now look for .zidb files instead of .zid files.


== Changes in zooimage 5.4-2

* Correction of one bug in the function addVigsToTrain().

* The functions activeLearning() and viewFrenchManual() were not exported in
  the NAMESPACE, but are required for the menus. Fixed.


== Changes in zooimage 5.4-1

* Correction of various bugs by Guillaume Wacquet.


== Changes in zooimage 5.4-0

* Functions to count cells in a particle (colony): countCells() and the
  corresponding countCellsGUI() function for an access through the menu.

* Function to build predictive models for cells in particles (colonies) after
  counting: cellModel().

* Function to compute the number of cells in particles in a new sample:
  cellCompute().

* Function to make zidb file for FlowCAM data through the menu:
  makeZidbMakeFlowCAM().

* Correct makeClass() function in the menu (missing formula).

* Functions to process active learning: contextSelection(), the associated
  addItemsToTrain() and dropItemsToTrain() functions to complete the training
  set with validated items, and the corresponding activeLearningGUI() function
  for an access through the menu. Integration in the classification process.

* Function compTrain() to compare two training sets and highlight differences.

* Translation of the user manual in French and update to include all changes.

* Adaptation of menus to include also the new features.


== Changes in zooimage 5.3-0

* calcVarsVIS() now included in calcVars() and not accessible any more as top
  function (to avoid duplicate code).

* ecd() and ecdCell() are now merged in ecd() using arguments cells = 1.

* errorCorrection() and planktonSorterPage() functions now use the new interface
  to get R httpd server port, for R svn rev >= 67550.

* In the shiny app, dataTableOutput is now called from the DT package.
  Dependency to DT is now added.

* The planktonSorter html page was sometimes too small, with the last group
  being wrapped consequently. Solved by increasing the page by 1 pixel * groups.

* A bug in processSample() prevented for calculation with both 'keep=' and a
  data frame for 'biomass=' provided simultaneously.


== Changes in zooimage 5.2-0

* importFlowCAM() now can deal with color FlowCAM images (but they are first
  converted into grayscale because background calibration images are recorded
  as grayscale by Visual Spreadsheet -at least, the tested version 3.2.3-, hence
  we cannot subtract the background of the vignettes in color mode)!

* importFlowCAM() now iterates a message to indicate progression of vignettes
  importation.

* For importFlowCAM(), the default value of the argument 'rgb.vigs' is changed
  from 'TRUE' to 'FALSE'.

* Functions to count cells in a particle (colony): cellCount() and the
  corresponding cellCountGUI() function for an access through the menu.

* New utility function ecdCell() to calculate the ECD for one cell in a colony.

## TODO:
* Functions to build predictive models for cells in particles (colonies) after counting:
  cellModel().

* Function to compute the number of cells in particles in a new sample: cellCompute().



* Function to make zidb file for FlowCAM data through the menu: zidbMakeFlowCAMGUI().

* Correct makeClass() function in the menu (missing formula).


== Changes in zooimage 5.1-0

* calcVars()/calcVarsVIS() and dropVars() are reworked to used only FIT_xxx
  variables in case of use of the FlowCAM (and to calculated many derived vars
  from there). This way, there is no need any more of a second image analysis
  in ImageJ.

* A new UI for error correction using shiny.


== Changes in zooimage 5.0-0

* importFlowCAM() and readFlowCAMlst() are reworked to create complete .zidb
  files using all metadata from various version of Fluid Imaging's Visual
  Spreadsheet software.


== Changes in zooimage 4.0-2

* correctError() has now a mode argument allowing to run the analysis in 'demo'
  and 'stat' mode, in addition to the default 'validation' mode

* The internal errorCorrection() function did not intialized ntrusted and
  nsuspect in 'demo' mode

* New version of the user manual (explanations of the new functions).


== Changes in zooimage 4.0-1

* A bug (non initialisation of the confusion matrix) prevented to use
  errorCorrection() in demo or stat mode. Corrected.


== Changes in zooimage 4.0-0

* Error correction functions added: correctError().

* Plankton sorter interface to manual validation added.

* New dependency on the digest package.

* A new menu entry, Validate classification..., is added for validation and
  error correction.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-7

* readFlowCAMlst() can now read Visual Spreadsheet .lst file format 017 where
  the name of the columns is explicitly provided in the header of the file.

* zimDatMakeFlowCAM() now uses readFlowCAMlst() instead of the hidden function
  .lstRead() to avoid duplicated code.

* zidVerify() now builds automatically the _dat1.zim file from FlowCAM data if
  it is not there, but corresponding .lst and .zim files are found in the parent
  directory.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-6

* zidUncompress() unzipped files in current dir., ignoring its path argument.
  Solved now.

* zidUncompressAll() now computes full names for zidfiles argument by default.

* calcVarsVIS() added. Specific function to calculate derived variables from
  FlowCAM's Visualspreadsheet software.

* Added the extraction of RGB vignettes when importing FlowCAM data.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-5

* Functions to import FlowCAM data directly.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-4

* Default dropVars(): adding a few items, including 'Skew', 'Kurt' and
  'Solidity' that produce NAs in ImageJ for multiple ROIs objects.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-3

* Minor adaptations to DESCRIPTION file.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-2

* Assignment to .GlobalEnv is strictly restricted to GUI operations, and only
  following direct request by the end-user through an explicit dialog box. The
  internal function .assignGlobal() is used for that purpose.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-1

* getTrain() was not able to collect data when attributes measured on samples
  mixed in training set differ slightly. Now, data are more carefully merged.

* Meaningless FIT_xxx attributes from the FlowCAM are now excluded by default
  in dropVars().

* The GUI function vignettesClass(), and thus, the corresponding menu entry
  were not implemented (the function prepareTest() that is called internally
  was working properly, but was not reacheable through the menu). Done now.

* The GUI function analyzeClass() and the corresponding menu entry listed old
  (version 2) items. The list is now updated with new plots available in
  zooimage 3 and mlearning 1.

* All the java code (ImageJ + zooimage plugins) are now moved to zooimageJ.


== Changes in zooimage 3.0-0

This is a major refactoring of code from zooimage 1.x and 2.X.
